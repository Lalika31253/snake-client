# Snake Client Project

When was the last time you played a classic snake game? This fun game takes you back to the time when cool games were simple.

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers.

The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here. 


## Getting Started
Clone the code from here: git clone https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer.git
CD over to snek-multiplayer folder and run `npm install` command in the terminal. This terminal will be responsible for server side. Run `npm run play` command to start the game.

Use second separate terminal windows which will be responsible for client side. CD over to snake-client folder in the terminal and run `node play.js` command to start the game.
